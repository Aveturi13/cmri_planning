# Cardiac MR image planning using Deep Learning

This repository contains code in support of my undergraduate thesis titled ["An Investigation into Automating Cardiac MRI Planning Using Deep Learning"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HMBELR6imF5oIfT0yk945QHc_9xHYFSR/view?usp=sharing). The code which I worked on during my project was written on Google Colab notebooks which can be accessed in the `notebooks/` directory. Currently, I am working on making the code executable through python scripts. 

## Requirements

The following libraries are required for running the code:

* NumPy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* Keras
* OpenCV
* TensorFlow
* argparse, os, sys

## Network Architectures

Below are the network architectures that are availible within the `networks/` directory.

* **UNet**
* **AlexNet**
